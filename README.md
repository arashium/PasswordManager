PasswordManager
===============

This is a firefox extension for helping user stores his password and encrypt them on his local computer.

This program does not use database. This program saves data in separate files and each file is encrypted separately.

This program is tested in Linux.

I wrote this program for my personal usage but now I intend to share it the others. However, I need help of the other people to: 

- Fixing codes and bugs.
- Make is cross platform (linux, windows and macOS) usable.
- I am not into detail of copywrites of used encryption codes and images. Please give me suggestions.
- Make the user interface more user-friendly.


Licence
===============
I shared this progam to make it available for usage of everybody. If you derive this code, inside your code somewhere please put the link of this repository as the base of your code.

Many thanks.
